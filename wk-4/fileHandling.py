try:
    # Ask the user for filename
    filename = input("Enter the filename to read: ")

    # Open file for reading
    file = open(filename, 'r')
    content = file.read()  # Read the content
    print("Original Content:\n", content)
    file.close()

    # Modify the content (convert to uppercase)
    modified_content = content.upper()
    print("\nModified Content:\n", modified_content)

    # Write modified content into a new file
    new_file = open('modified_' + filename, 'w')
    new_file.write(modified_content)
    new_file.close()

    print("\nFile modified successfully and saved as: modified_" + filename)

except FileNotFoundError:
    print("File not found. Please check the filename and try again.")

finally:
    try:
        file.close()
    except:
