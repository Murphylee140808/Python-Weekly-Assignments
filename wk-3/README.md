Discount Calculator 🛒💸

This is a simple Python program that calculates the final price of an item after applying a discount. 
The discount is only applied if the discount percentage is 20% or more; otherwise, the price remains unchanged.

📌 Features

Takes user input for the original price and discount percentage.

Applies a discount only if it’s 20% or higher.

Returns and displays the final price with clear messaging.

🛠️ How It Works

The user enters:

The original price of the item.

The discount percentage.

The program checks:

If the discount percentage is ≥ 20%, it applies the discount.

If the discount percentage is < 20%, it does not apply the discount.

The program prints the final price with a user-friendly message.

✅ Discount applied! The final price is: 750.00
