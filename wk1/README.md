echo "# 🐍 Week 1 – Basic Calculator Program

This is a **simple command-line calculator** written in Python.  
It allows the user to **input two numbers** and an **arithmetic operator**, then performs the corresponding calculation and displays the result.

## ✨ Features
- Accepts user input for **two numbers** and **one operator**.
- Supports four basic arithmetic operations:
  - ➕ **Addition** (+)
  - ➖ **Subtraction** (-)
  - ✖ **Multiplication** (*)
  - ➗ **Division** (/)
- Displays the result in a clear format, e.g.:
  10 + 5 = 15

## 📂 How It Works
1. The program asks the user for:
   - **First number**
   - **Operator** (+, -, *, /)
   - **Second number**
2. It performs the calculation based on the chosen operator.
3. The result is printed in the format:
   number1 operator number2 = result

## 💻 Example Run
Enter first number: 10
Enter operator (+, -, *, /): +
Enter second number: 5
10 + 5 = 15
