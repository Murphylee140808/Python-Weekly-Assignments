# OOP Assignments 🚀

This project covers Object-Oriented Programming concepts in Python.

## 📌 Assignment 1: Superhero Class 🦸
- Created a `Superhero` base class with **encapsulation** (private attributes).
- Implemented **inheritance** with `FlyingHero` and `StrongHero`.
- Used **polymorphism** via `introduce()` method.

## 📌 Activity 2: Polymorphism with Vehicles 🚗✈️🚤
- Defined a base `Vehicle` class.
- Implemented `Car`, `Plane`, and `Boat`, each with their own `move()` behavior.
- Demonstrates **polymorphism** in action.

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes
- Encapsulation (private attributes, getters).
- Inheritance and method overriding.
- Polymorphism in real-world examples.
